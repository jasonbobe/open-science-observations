# The Future of Open Science
## About
I'm putting together a catalog of the dominant cultural paradigms in science. Some examples include the cultures around academic publishing, academic funding, data sharing, diversity in science, etc. I'd like to collect your thoughts, feelings, and facts about the world of science as we know it. 

By collecting these responses, I hope to better understand what aspects of science could be improved, how those aspects might be improved, and why those aspects are broken.  

Ultimately, I hope to use your responses as a way to imagine what a future of open science might look like and offer some kind of visual feedback about the world of science we could be particpating in if we could change it from the ground up.

## Questions
