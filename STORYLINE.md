# Open Science Future

## Storyline

We want to communicate how things are in the future after science has become completely open. 

We want to show different scenarios into the major themes/aspects that a world of completely open science would enable and change.

How to organize the story?

* Geographically - bounce between several countries to reveal the changes that have occured.
	* 	e.g. 
		* in Kenya:
		* in Korea:
		* in Brazil:
		* in America:
		* in Canada:
		* in Germany:
		* in France: 

* The intro should be a paragraph that explains, "In year YYYY, the model of scientific research was completely rebuilt... this led to X, Y, Z. This is what the world looks like now..."
	* In the early 21st century, a scientific revolution occurred which toppled the established methods of doing and disseminating scientfic knowledge - this was called the La Revolution D'Access Pour Tous (The Open Access Revolution). The revolution was in effect a response to the mounting pressures from global climate change and the spread of antibiotic resistant viruses that pressed the world - scientists and the public alike - to work together to develop innovative and holistic solutions. Since the revolution, open science has become the dominant paradigm leading to a new geography of science.
