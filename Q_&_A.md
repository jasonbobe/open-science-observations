# Q & A
Here's a few guiding questions to field feedback about what a completely open science future would look like:

**Setup**: Imagine in 50 years, open science is the dominant paradigm. What does the *world* look like because of this?

I want to ask questions about *what could be* rather than *what will be* to frame a more general and global understanding of *the future of sciene we want to see* .

## Questions

### General


> What does the world remember from a world of closed access / predatory publishing / inaccessible data etc in science?

> At what point and *why* did science become open?

> What are the major discoveries or scientific breakthroughs that have occured as a result of a world of open science?

> how have science and the web evolved in this open science world? what does the technology look like that is enabling this open science world?



<!--
> What does it mean to participate in science now that science is open? Who are the new participants? How are they participating?
-->




### Specific

> What is the most compelling perspective? From the point-of-view (POV) of a student, researcher, professor? 


> What does the publishing model look like? How about peer review?


> What is the role of publishers? Are there even publishers?



> What does scientific funding look like?


> What happens when data is available and accessible?

> What does science education look like? How about science literacy?

> Which countries have become empowered to excel in a particular field? Why?
